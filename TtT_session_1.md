####Terminology used in learning

Terminology used in learning is far from standardised. The several branches of the learning community have adopted different variants and occasionlly re-use terms in different contexts with slightly different meaning. Here we try to offer sets of definitions that will help you to survive.

Before we do that, let us propose a minimal subset of specific terms, by choice, that we will try to use in the context of bioinformatics training in  a  consistent way. We will prefer to use the term INSTRUCTOR  instead of teacher or professor. We will use the term LEARNER instead of student. These choices are adopted just because they are more encompassing.

Here we offer lists of definitions that seem useful. Inevitably, for the reasons isted above, you will find inconsistencies here  and there. You will need to learn how to deal with the situation.

In the following list, most definitions are taken from the [Glossary of Online Learning Terms](http://theelearningcoach.com/resources/online-learning-glossary-of-terms/); see also the Glossary of "Learning" Terms, Georgia Institute of Technology [(PDF)](docs/learningterms.pdf). 

* **ACTIVE LEARNING**: A process whereby learners are actively engaged in the learning process, rather than "passively" absorbing lectures. Active learning involves reading, writing, discussion, and engagement in solving problems, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Active learning often involves cooperative learning (from the [Glossary of education terms on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_education_terms)). 
* **ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING**: When learners participate in an online learning course at different times. This might also be called eLearning or web-based training (WBT). Asynchronous learning allows learners to go through a course at their own pace and on their own schedule.
* **BLENDED LEARNING or HYBRID LEARNING**: It is an instructional approach that includes a combination of online and in-person learning activities. For example, students can complete online self-paced assignments by a certain date and then meet on-site or online for additional learning activities.
* **COURSEWARE**: Courseware refers to any instructional software that is delivered on a computer.
* **DISTANCE EDUCATION or DISTANCE LEARNING**: Distance Education/Learning occurs when students and their instructors are in different geographical locations and the instruction occurs on an electronic device, such as a computer or mobile phone. The learning can occur in a synchronous environment, in which all participants are connected at the same time or in an asynchronous environment, when participants are engaged in learning at different times.
* **eLEARNING**:eLearning (short for electronic learning) is an umbrella term that refers to all types of training, education and instruction that occurs on a digital medium, like a computer or mobile phone. The term evolved from Enhanced Learning which was actually more encompassing and acccurate.
* **INFORMAL LEARNING**: Informal learning occurs when people have a need to know something. They set their own learning objectives and acquire knowledge, skills and information in their own ways. This could be through asking questions, observing experts, practicing and conversing. It’s the kind of natural learning humans do outside of a structured environment.
* **INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN**: Instructional design involves the identification of the knowledge, information, and skill gaps of a particular group of people and creating or selecting learning experiences that close this gap. Instructional designers base their learning decisions on cognitive psychology, instructional theory and best practices.
* **INSTRUCTOR LED TRAINING (ILT)**: ILT typically refers to providing instruction in a classroom environment where the instructor and learners are together at the same time and in the same physical location.
* **MOBILE LEARNING**: Learning that takes place on a hand-held device, such as a mobile phone, that can take place anytime and anywhere.
* **MULTIMEDIA**: Multimedia refers to the presentation of information and instruction through a combination of graphics, audio, text, or video. Multimedia instruction is often interactive.
* **ONLINE LEARNING**: The term online learning is often used synonymously with eLearning. It is an umbrella term that includes any type of learning accomplished on a computer and usually over the Internet.
* **SELF-PACED LEARNING**: Self-paced learning refers to the type of instruction that allows a person to control the flow of the courseware. It implies the learning environment is asynchronous.
* **SOCIAL MEDIA LEARNING**: Social media learning refers to the acquisition of information and skills through social technologies that allow people to collaborate, converse, provide input, create content and share it. Examples of social media learning can occur through online social networking platforms, blogs and microblogs (like Twitter), online talk radio and wikis.
* **SYNCHRONOUS LEARNING**: When learners participate in an online learning course at the same time but in different locations, it is known as synchronous learning. Synchronous learning allows learners to interact with the instructor and other participants. This is done through software that creates a virtual classroom. 
* **VIRTUAL CLASSROOM**: The virtual classroom refers to a digital classroom learning environment that takes place over the Internet rather than in a physical classroom. It is implemented through software that allows an instructor and students to interact.
* **WEB-BASED TRAINING (WBT)**: WBT refers to all types of digital instruction in which the learning material is presented via the Internet.

####Learning objectives and learning outcomes

These two terms are often used interchangeably by the community. Even worse, they are often abbreviated by the acronym (LO), thus introducing even more ambiguity. In our opinion there is no need. Objectives (aims) and Outcomes (results) may overlap, but are not genuinely the same.

Here is an attempt to clarify this situation and remove the ambiguities:

###Learning Objectives
 * Objectives describe the goals and intentions of the instructor.
 * Objectives, often termed the input in the course, state the purpose and goals of the course.
 * Objectives focus on content and skills important within the classroom or program.
 * Objectives may describe what the instructors will do.
 * Objectives can often be numerous, specific, and detailed.

###Learning Outcomes
 * Student Learning Outcomes catalog the overarching "products" of the course and are the
evidence that the goals or objectives were achieved.
 * Learning Outcomes are statements that describe or list measurable and essential mastered
content-knowledge—reflecting skills, competencies, and knowledge that students have
achieved and can demonstrate upon successfully completing a course.
 * Outcomes express higher-level thinking skills that integrate course content and activities and
can be observed as a behavior, skill, or discrete useable knowledge upon completing the
course.
 * Outcomes are exactly what assessments are intended to show – specifically what the student
will be able to do upon completing the course.
 * An assessable outcome can be displayed or observed and evaluated against criteria.
 * Outcomes are clear and measurable criteria for guiding the teaching, learning, and
assessment process in the course.

Adapted from http://provost.rpi.edu/learning-assessment/learning-outcomes/objectives-vs-outcomes


**Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives (1956) - Cognitive Skills**: A group of educators, led by Benjamin Bloom, identified a hierarchy of six categories of cognitive skills: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.  As students learn, they start with the knowledge level and progress through the hierarchy.  Thus, advanced courses should include skills at a higher level than introductory or basic skills courses.  Below you will find a web-resource as well as a list of measurable verbs to assist you in writing course objectives and assess learning outcomes.


**Verbs that are often used but are better to avoid because they are open to many interpretations**: appreciate, have faith in, know, learn, understand, believe.

"Learning results from what the student does and thinks and only from what the student does and thinks. The teacher can advance learning only by influencing what the student does to learn" (H.A. Simon)

**What is learning?**

- Learning is not a product but a process occurring in the mind. As such, we can only infer that it has occurred from students' products or performance
- Learning involves change in knowledge, beliefs, behaviours, or attitudes
- Learning is not something done to students, but rather something students themselves do.


The seven principles of learning:

1.	Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning
	What does the research tell us about prior knowledge?
	What teaching strategies does the research suggest?
2.	How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know
3.	Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn
4.	To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and how and when to apply what they have learned
5.	Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning
6.	Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning
7.	To become self-directd leaners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.

####What is formal and non-formal learning?

Reference source http://www.oecd.org/edu/skills-beyond-school/recognitionofnon-formalandinformallearning-home.htm

We quote:

"Formal learning is always organised and structured, and has learning objectives. From the learner’s standpoint, it is always intentional: i.e. the learner’s explicit objective is to gain knowledge, skills and/or competences. Typical examples are learning that takes place within the initial education and training system or workplace training arranged by the employer. One can also speak about formal education and/or training or, more accurately speaking, education and/or training in a formal setting. This definition is rather consensual.

Informal learning is never organised, has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner’s standpoint. Often it is referred to as learning by experience or just as experience. The idea is that the simple fact of existing constantly exposes the individual to learning situations, at work, at home or during leisure time for instance. This definition, with a few exceptions (see Werquin, 2007) also meets with a fair degree of consensus.

Mid-way between the first two, non-formal learning is the concept on which there is the least consensus, which is not to say that there is consensus on the other two, simply that the wide variety of approaches in this case makes consensus even more difficult. Nevertheless, for the majority of authors, it seems clear that non-formal learning is rather organised and can have learning objectives. The advantage of the intermediate concept lies in the fact that such learning may occur at the initiative of the individual but also happens as a by-product of more organised activities, whether or not the activities themselves have learning objectives. In some countries, the entire sector of adult learning falls under non-formal learning; in others, most adult learning is formal. Non-formal learning therefore gives some flexibility between formal and informal learning, which must be strictly defined to be operational, by being mutually exclusive, and avoid overlap."


In this concern, a bioinformatics training course will most often be best classified as a NON_FORMAL learning instance.
Whreas a semester course in a university would most often be classified as FORMAL and an impromptu demonstration session on RNA-seq could be better classified as INFORMAL learning.

We may pragmatically think of EFFICIENT bioinformatics training provision in the following NON-FORMALway
* It provides essentially skills, rather than deep knowledge
* It aims at the acquisition of competences
* It must focus on the learner (learner-centric)
* It must guarantee that independently reproducible outcomes are obtained
* The learners must acquire autonomy (skills usage independence)

The EFFICIENCY of training can - and should - be independently assessed by the capability of reaching the desired OUTCOMES, in the context of the stated OBJECTIVES.

Please bear in mind that we are speaking about educating ADULTS. This is important because adults have their interests focused of their self-improvement, and see training as a capacity-building exercise. Adults like to be respected as such, that their expectations are individually met, in an exhaustive way.

####Relevant models from cognitive science

Learning is supported by a load of theories, some of them developed by schools of thought and large groups of enthusiastic followers. In the context of our session it may matter to recall some major points about them. It matters to say that most theories have been developed havin the child learner in mind, so some aspects that reflectbthis bias will not apply to our activity.

Behaviourism (started in the early 20th century by John Broadus Watson):
* Learning is acquiring new behaviours by conditioning.
* Reflex response to stimuli
* Reward / Punishment
* * Ref: "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It" , 1913

Cognitivism (started in 1920 by Jean Piaget):
* Learning is based on the development of cognitive capabilities.
* Its origin is in the "Gestalt Psychlogie"

Connectivism (started in the 1980s by Stephen Downes and George Siemens):
* Knowledge is perceived from the environment and resides in connections.
* No agents form connections better than a learner's brain itself.
* The instructors act as facilitators. They create the environmental conditions that allow true learning to occur.
