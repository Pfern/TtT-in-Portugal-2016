####Terminology used in learning
Most definitions are taken from the [Glossary of Online Learning Terms](http://theelearningcoach.com/resources/online-learning-glossary-of-terms/); see also the Glossary of "Learning" Terms, Georgia Institute of Technology [(PDF)](docs/learningterms.pdf). Adaptations were introduced as necessary.

* **ACTIVE LEARNING**: A process whereby learners are actively engaged in the learning process, rather than "passively" absorbing lectures. Active learning involves reading, writing, discussion, and engagement in solving problems, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Active learning often involves cooperative learning (from the [Glossary of education terms on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_education_terms)). 
* **ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING**: When learners participate in an online learning course at different times. This might also be called eLearning or web-based training (WBT). Asynchronous learning allows learners to go through a course at their own pace and on their own schedule.
* **BLENDED LEARNING or HYBRID LEARNING**: It is an instructional approach that includes a combination of online and in-person learning activities. For example, students can complete online self-paced assignments by a certain date and then meet on-site or online for additional learning activities.
* **COURSEWARE**: Courseware refers to any instructional software that is delivered on a computer.
* **DISTANCE EDUCATION or DISTANCE LEARNING**: Distance Education/Learning occurs when students and their instructors are in different geographical locations and the instruction occurs on an electronic device, such as a computer or mobile phone. The learning can occur in a synchronous environment, in which all participants are connected at the same time or in an asynchronous environment, when participants are engaged in learning at different times.
* **eLEARNING**:eLearning (short for electronic learning) is an umbrella term that refers to all types of training, education and instruction that occurs on a digital medium, like a computer or mobile phone. The term evolved from Enhanced Learning which was actually more encompassing and acccurate.
* **INFORMAL LEARNING**: Informal learning occurs when people have a need to know something. They set their own learning objectives and acquire knowledge, skills and information in their own ways. This could be through asking questions, observing experts, practicing and conversing. It’s the kind of natural learning humans do outside of a structured environment.
* **INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN**: Instructional design involves the identification of the knowledge, information, and skill gaps of a particular group of people and creating or selecting learning experiences that close this gap. Instructional designers base their learning decisions on cognitive psychology, instructional theory and best practices.
* **INSTRUCTOR LED TRAINING (ILT)**: ILT typically refers to providing instruction in a classroom environment where the instructor and learners are together at the same time and in the same physical location.
* **MOBILE LEARNING**: Learning that takes place on a hand-held device, such as a mobile phone, that can take place anytime and anywhere.
* **MULTIMEDIA**: Multimedia refers to the presentation of information and instruction through a combination of graphics, audio, text, or video. Multimedia instruction is often interactive.
* **ONLINE LEARNING**: The term online learning is often used synonymously with eLearning. It is an umbrella term that includes any type of learning accomplished on a computer and usually over the Internet.
* **SELF-PACED LEARNING**: Self-paced learning refers to the type of instruction that allows a person to control the flow of the courseware. It implies the learning environment is asynchronous.
* **SOCIAL MEDIA LEARNING**: Social media learning refers to the acquisition of information and skills through social technologies that allow people to collaborate, converse, provide input, create content and share it. Examples of social media learning can occur through online social networking platforms, blogs and microblogs (like Twitter), online talk radio and wikis.
* **SYNCHRONOUS LEARNING**: When learners participate in an online learning course at the same time but in different locations, it is known as synchronous learning. Synchronous learning allows learners to interact with the instructor and other participants. This is done through software that creates a virtual classroom. 
* **VIRTUAL CLASSROOM**: The virtual classroom refers to a digital classroom learning environment that takes place over the Internet rather than in a physical classroom. It is implemented through software that allows an instructor and students to interact.
* **WEB-BASED TRAINING (WBT)**: WBT refers to all types of digital instruction in which the learning material is presented via the Internet.

#Learning objectives and outcomes

####Learning Objectives
* * Objectives describe the goals and intentions of the instructor.
* * Objectives, often termed the input in the course, state the purpose and goals of the course.
* * Objectives focus on content and skills important within the classroom or program.
* * Objectives may describe what the instructors will do.
* * Objectives can often be numerous, specific, and detailed.

####Learning Outcomes
* * Student Learning Outcomes catalog the overarching "products" of the course and are the
evidence that the goals or objectives were achieved.
* * Learning Outcomes are statements that describe or list measurable and essential mastered
content-knowledge—reflecting skills, competencies, and knowledge that students have
achieved and can demonstrate upon successfully completing a course.
* * Outcomes express higher-level thinking skills that integrate course content and activities and
can be observed as a behavior, skill, or discrete useable knowledge upon completing the
course.
* * Outcomes are exactly what assessments are intended to show – specifically what the student
will be able to do upon completing the course.
* * An assessable outcome can be displayed or observed and evaluated against criteria.
* * Outcomes are clear and measurable criteria for guiding the teaching, learning, and
assessment process in the course.

Adapted from http://provost.rpi.edu/learning-assessment/learning-outcomes/objectives-vs-outcomes


**Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives (1956) - Cognitive Skills**: A group of educators, led by Benjamin Bloom, identified a hierarchy of six categories of cognitive skills: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.  As students learn, they start with the knowledge level and progress through the hierarchy.  Thus, advanced courses should include skills at a higher level than introductory or basic skills courses.  Below you will find a web-resource as well as a list of measurable verbs to assist you in writing course objectives and assess learning outcomes.


**Verbs that are often used but are better to avoid because they are open to many interpretations**: appreciate, have faith in, know, learn, understand, believe.

"Learning results from what the student does and thinks and only from what the student does and thinks. The teacher can advance learning only by influencing what the student does to learn" (H.A. Simon)

**What is learning?**

- Learning is not a product but a process occurring in the mind. As such, we can only infer that it has occurred from students' products or performance
- Learning involves change in knowledge, beliefs, behaviours, or attitudes
- Learning is not something done to students, but rather something students themselves do.


The seven principles of learning:

1.	Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning
	What does the research tell us about prior knowledge?
	What teaching strategies does the research suggest?
2.	How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know
3.	Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn
4.	To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and how and when to apply what they have learned
5.	Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning
6.	Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning
7.	To become self-directd leaners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.
