###Terminology used in learning
Most definitions are taken from the [Glossary of Online Learning Terms](http://theelearningcoach.com/resources/online-learning-glossary-of-terms/); see also the Glossary of "Learning" Terms, Georgia Institute of Technology [(PDF)](docs/learningterms.pdf).

* **ACTIVE LEARNING**: A process whereby learners are actively engaged in the learning process, rather than "passively" absorbing lectures. Active learning involves reading, writing, discussion, and engagement in solving problems, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Active learning often involves cooperative learning (from the [Glossary of education terms on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_education_terms)). 
* **ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING**: When learners participate in an online learning course at different times. This might also be called eLearning or web-based training (WBT). Asynchronous learning allows learners to go through a course at their own pace and on their own schedule.
* **BLENDED LEARNING or HYBRID LEARNING**: It is an instructional approach that includes a combination of online and in-person learning activities. For example, students can complete online self-paced assignments by a certain date and then meet on-site or online for additional learning activities.
* **COURSEWARE**: Courseware refers to any instructional software that is delivered on a computer.
* **DISTANCE EDUCATION or DISTANCE LEARNING**: Distance Education/Learning occurs when students and their instructors are in different geographical locations and the instruction occurs on an electronic device, such as a computer or mobile phone. The learning can occur in a synchronous environment, in which all participants are connected at the same time or in an asynchronous environment, when participants are engaged in learning at different times.
* **eLEARNING**:eLearning (short for electronic learning) is an umbrella term that refers to all types of training, education and instruction that occurs on a digital medium, like a computer or mobile phone.
* **INFORMAL LEARNING**: Informal learning occurs when people have a need to know something. They set their own learning objectives and acquire knowledge, skills and information in their own ways. This could be through asking questions, observing experts, practicing and conversing. It’s the kind of natural learning humans do outside of a structured environment.
* **INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN**: Instructional design involves the identification of the knowledge, information, and skill gaps of a particular group of people and creating or selecting learning experiences that close this gap. Instructional designers base their learning decisions on cognitive psychology, instructional theory and best practices.
* **INSTRUCTOR LED TRAINING (ILT)**: ILT typically refers to providing instruction in a classroom environment where the instructor and learners are together at the same time and in the same physical location.
* **LEARNING OBJECTIVES**: Learning objectives describe the goals and intentions of the instructor who teaches the course. They state the purpose and goals of a session or of the course.
* **LEARNING OUTCOMES**: A Learning Outcome is an outcome statement that captures specifically what knowledge, skills, attitudes learners should be able to exhibit following instruction.
* **MOBILE LEARNING**: Learning that takes place on a hand-held device, such as a mobile phone, that can take place anytime and anywhere.
* **MULTIMEDIA**: Multimedia refers to the presentation of information and instruction through a combination of graphics, audio, text, or video. Multimedia instruction is often interactive.
* **ONLINE LEARNING**: The term online learning is often used synonymously with eLearning. It is an umbrella term that includes any type of learning accomplished on a computer and usually over the Internet.
* **SELF-PACED LEARNING**: Self-paced learning refers to the type of instruction that allows a person to control the flow of the courseware. It implies the learning environment is asynchronous.
* **SOCIAL MEDIA LEARNING**: Social media learning refers to the acquisition of information and skills through social technologies that allow people to collaborate, converse, provide input, create content and share it. Examples of social media learning can occur through online social networking platforms, blogs and microblogs (like Twitter), online talk radio and wikis.
* **SYNCHRONOUS LEARNING**: When learners participate in an online learning course at the same time but in different locations, it is known as synchronous learning. Synchronous learning allows learners to interact with the instructor and other participants. This is done through software that creates a virtual classroom. 
* **VIRTUAL CLASSROOM**: The virtual classroom refers to a digital classroom learning environment that takes place over the Internet rather than in a physical classroom. It is implemented through software that allows an instructor and students to interact.
* **WEB-BASED TRAINING (WBT)**: WBT refers to all types of digital instruction in which the learning material is presented via the Internet.

###Learning aims, objectives and outcomes

**Aims** are broad statements of what learning the instructor hopes to generate. The **aim** is the point of the whole thing. As such, even hard-liners concede that it can be fairly vague, and non-behavioural terms, such as “understand”, and “appreciate” or “develop” are rather reluctantly accepted. The Aim is almost certainly more than the sum of the Objectives, and regardless of what many people say, the Aim is what matters. It is the End, and all the rest is just Means.

**Objectives** are statements of what you are setting out to teach, although expressed as if the students were going to learn it..

**Outcomes** (more accurately “desired outcomes”) are statements of what you might (in principle) assess. You may not end up assessing all of them, but they are statements of what a student will know or be able to do, if she or he has learned everything in the course or session.

**See also** the [PDF] (docs/Objectives_vs_Outcomes.pdf) document from the [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Office of the Provost](http://provost.rpi.edu/institutional-research)

####Learning outcomes should be SMART
||||
|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
|Specific|They should state clearly what the student should know/be able to do, and at what level|What?|
|Measurable|You should be able to conceive of how their attainment might be assessed|By trainee / trainer or both?|
|Achievable| by the learners|Is it possible in this context?|
|Realistic|Could be seen as similar to attainability, but refers to their appropriateness to the overall task. "Valid" in assessment-speak|Can we really train them to do this?|
|Time-limited|Or achievable within the time-span of the session/lesson/course|In what time?|

###The Bloom's six categories of cognitive skills

**Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives (1956) - Cognitive Skills**: A group of educators, led by Benjamin Bloom, identified a hierarchy of six categories of cognitive skills: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.  As students learn, they start with the knowledge level and progress through the hierarchy.  Thus, advanced courses should include skills at a higher level than introductory or basic skills courses.  Below you will find a web-resource as well as a list of measurable verbs to assist you in writing course objectives and assess learning outcomes.

####From taxonomy to verbs…

**Verbs that are often used but are better to avoid because they are open to many interpretations**: appreciate, have faith in, know, learn, understand, believe.

"Learning results from what the student does and thinks and only from what the student does and thinks. The teacher can advance learning only by influencing what the student does to learn" (H.A. Simon)

**What is learning?**

- Learning is not a product but a process occurring in the mind. As such, we can only infer that it has occurred from students' products or performance
- Learning involves change in knowledge, beliefs, behaviours, or attitudes
- Learning is not something done to students, but rather something students themselves do.


**The seven principles of learning**:

- **Principle P1**:	Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning
	What does the research tell us about prior knowledge?
	What teaching strategies does the research suggest?
- **Principle P2**:	How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know
- **Principle P3**:	Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn
- **Principle P4**:	To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and how and when to apply what they have learned
- **Principle P5**:	Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning
- **Principle P6**:	Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning
- **Principle P7**:	To become self-directd leaners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.

**Instructional strategies that collectively address all seven principles (P1-P7)**:

- **Strategy S1**: Collect data about students and use it to design instruction (P1,P3).
- **Strategy S2**: Be explicit aboyt your learning goals, learning objectives and expecations (P3, P5, P6). Make your learning foals challenging but attainable by most of the learners in your course. Write detailed learning outcomes that spell out what the learners should be able to do (define, explain, calculate, model, critique, design,...) if they have aquired the knowledge and skills you are trying to help them to develop, and share your objectives with the learners.
- **Strategy S3**: Scaffold complex tasks (P2-P7). Teach and test at a level that is challenging but not too far abouve the learners' current klnowledge and skill levels.
- **Strategy S4**: Help learners learn to funcion like experts (P2, P4, P7). Have learners formulate solution strategies before beginning to work on new problems, and when they complete assignments have them reflect on what they learned and what they will do differently in the future. 
- **Strategy S5**: Establish a supportive class climate (P3, P6). Learn and use learners' names and encourage them to interact with you in and out the course. Collect anonymous learner feedback and investigate and respond to any complaints related to class climate.

###What is formal and non-formal learning?

###Relevant models from cognitive science

####Kolb's learning styles

---

David Kolb published his learning styles model in 1984 from which he developed his learning style inventory.

Kolb's experiential learning theory works on two levels: a four stage cycle of learning and four separate learning styles.  Much of Kolb’s theory is concerned with the learner’s internal cognitive processes.

Kolb states that learning involves the acquisition of abstract concepts that can be applied flexibly in a range of situations.  In Kolb’s theory, the impetus for the development of new concepts is provided by new experiences.

“Learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience” (Kolb, 1984, p. 38).

Kolb's experiential learning style theory is typically represented by a four stage learning cycle in which the learner 'touches all the bases':

![Kolb's learning cycle](fig/learning-kolb.jpg)

Kolb's cycle in detail:

1. Concrete Experience - A new experience of situation is encountered, or a reinterpretation of existing experience.

2. Reflective Observation (of the new experience. Of particular importance are any inconsistencies between experience and understanding).

3. Abstract Conceptualization (Reflection gives rise to a new idea, or a modification of an existing abstract concept).

4. Active Experimentation (the learner applies them to the world around them to see what results).

Effective learning is seen when a person progresses through a cycle of four stages: of (1) having a concrete experience followed by (2) observation of and reflection on that experience which leads to (3) the formation of abstract concepts (analysis) and generalizations (conclusions) which are then (4) used to test hypothesis in future situations, resulting in new experiences.

Kolb (1974) views learning as an integrated process with each stage being mutually supportive of and feeding into the next. It is possible to enter the cycle at any stage and follow it through its logical sequence.

However, effective learning only occurs when a learner is able to execute all four stages of the model. Therefore, no one stage of the cycle is an effective as a learning procedure on its own.

####Honey & Mumford (1986) Learning Styles

---

Learning Styles were developed by Peter Honey and Alan Mumford, based upon the work of Kolb, and they identified four distinct learning styles or preferences: Activist, Theorist; Pragmatist and Reflector, although it is possible to have traits from more than one. If this is the case with a learner it means that he or she will be able to learn well in more than one way. Learning styles are the learning approaches that individuals naturally prefer and they recommend that in order to maximise one's own personal learning each learner ought to:

- understand their learning style
- seek out opportunities to learn using that style

To understand your particular learning style Honey and Mumford have developed a [Learning Style Questionnaire](docs/learning-styles-questionnaire-honey-and-mumford.doc) and with this information you will be in a far better position to do three really useful things [quoting P. Honey]:

- Become smarter at getting a better fit between learning opportunities and the way you learn best. This makes your learning easier, more effective and more enjoyable. It saves you tackling your learning on a hit-and-miss basis. Equipped with information about your learning preferences, you'll have many more hits and fewer misses.
- Expand the 'band width' of experiences from which you derive benefit. Becoming an all-round learner, increases your versatility and helps you learn from a wide variety of different experiences - some formal, some informal, some planned and some spontaneous.
- Improve your learning skills and processes. Increased awareness of how you learn, opens up the whole process to self-scrutiny and improvement. Learning to learn is your most important capability since it provides the gateway to everything else you want to develop

|Learning style|What activities different styles relate to|
|---------------------|---------------|
|Activist|Brainstorming, problem solving, group discussion, puzzles, competitions, role-play|
|Theorist|Models, statistics, stories, quotes, background information, applying theories|
|Reflector|Paired discussions, self analysis questionnaires, personality questionnaires, time out, observing activities, feedback from others, coaching, interviews|
|Pragmatist|Time to think about how to apply learning in reality, case studies, problem solving, discussion|

How to apply these?

- No chance of running a questionnaire at the beginning!
- Must consider that you will have a mix of styles in your group, so need to provide learning materials / activities that will apply to many

Learning activities: main thing to remember:

- People can only concentrate for short periods – often 15 – 20 minutes at most, before it drops
- For lecture sessions – intersperse with activities eg questions, short problems, discussion points
- For practical sessions – check on where the group as a whole is, or have demonstrators who can move around the room

In cognitive psychology, cognitive load refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory. Cognitive load theory was developed out of the study of problem solving by John Sweller in the late 1980s. Sweller argued that instructional design can be used to reduce cognitive load in learners. Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.
Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

Intrinsic cognitive load is the effort associated with a specific topic. Extraneous cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner. And, germane cognitive load refers to the work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge, or a schema.
