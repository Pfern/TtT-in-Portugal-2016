PEDRO

Bioinformatics training targets a wide range of subjects that have very different needs in terms of the machinery needed to run exercises. However, there are design constraints that every training room should respect. And these are important in the initial planning, and in improvements that one may consider in their lifetime.

Room geometry

The design of modern Bioinformatics training rooms should, primarily, be learner centered. Space to circulate, to allow for instructors to reach learners and interact with them is abolutely essential. Learner comfort comes next: the quality of the seats, the lighting, the room temperature control, the stability of power and network connections, these are all aspects that have serious impacts in learner satisfaction.

Functionality

Learners aceess to anything that is shared should be in the first line of priority. Access to shared storage space should be made easy. To communicate with the learners, video, audio, drawing surfaces (whiteboard, flipchart paper), a corkboard to pin materials, etc. should have premium access and ease of use.

Hardware neeeds
In some subjects, network connections providing simple browing (Port 80) or SSH acceess (Port 22) are more than sufficient. In that case, BYOD (bring your own device) can be adequate. The room must have easy power and network connections, including a good quality wifi access. 

Presently, playing with relatively demanding software in local machines is still needed. You may need to play with assemblers and mappers for NGS data, for example. For that, well configured workstations (enhaced  PCs) are still the best choice. Foreseeably virtualised environments on performant hardware will end-up reducing  this need to the level of lightweight terminal equipment, but we are still on the way to get such facilities in place with adequate quality.

The working environment for learners should be entirely reproducible. First, inside the training room, the environment must be the same for everybody. Secondly, the learners should feel that they can reproduce the same  environment when they go home after a training event. Again, virtualised environments can be a solution. However, the training roo physical facilities will not travel, so one must think about what will and will not work in a home or a lab environment and at least explain what can be done.
