**Purpose**
The GTPB, in cooperation with the ELIXIR Train-The-Trainer subtask, will hold a Train the Trainer (TtT) event in connection with the BPBR16 Training course “Bioinformatics using Python for Biomedical Researchers“ on July 10th-15th 2016.

The learning objectives of the first day (Sunday, July 10th) consist of exploring, discussing and understanding four main themes: 

* [Learning principles and how they apply to training](./TtT_session_1.md)
* [Training techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation] (./TtT_session_2.md)
* [Session, course, and materials design] (./TtT_session_3.md)
* [Assessment and feedback in training] (./TtT_session_4.md)

The following days (from Monday to friday) TtT participants will be able to act as training assistants, and will attend end-of-the-day recapitulation meetings where the effectiveness of the methods is assessed and discussed. They will be asked to prepare short reports as assignments.

> ### Learning outcomes
> * Learners can tell which learning principles a good trainer should have in mind
> * Learners can describe at least three training techniques drawing on learning principles
> * Learners can design a training session and a course
> * Learners can develop assessment questionnaires
> * Learners can tell what types of material are needed for each part of a training session

### Session 1: Review of learning principles and how they apply to training
 
 * [Terminology used in learning;](#term)
 * Learning aims, objectives and outcomes;
 * The Bloom's six categories of cognitive skills;
 * How learning works: research-based principles of learning and their implications for teaching practice;
 * What is formal and non-formal learning?
 * Relevant models from cognitive science;
 * Cognitive load.

### Session 2: Training techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation
 * Delivering a learning event as a mission; establishing learning mode, teamwork and mutual trust;
 * Teaching as a preformance art: promoting learner engagement;
 * The GOBLET skills matrix for trainers;
 * Motivation and demotivation;
 * Closed loop learning delivery;
 * Learning by doing;
 * Retention;
 * Priming; 
 * Self-confidence and usage independence;
 * Carpentry teaching practices (http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/15-practices/);
 * The role of wrap-up sessions;

### Session 3: Session, course, and materials design
* Training session design and plan;
* From session to course design;
* Training rooms for Bioinformatics, Reproducibility of training environments;
* Training materials: designing, producing, delivering;
* Training materials: Archival; Sharing; Making re-use possible;
* Training materials repositories and resources: GOBLET, TeSS, GitHub, etc.
* Preparatory steps for training delivery;

### Session 4: Assessment and feedback in training
* Formative and summative assessment;
* Using questionnaires to promote peer instruction and content delivery;
* The role of questioning in learning; Formative Assessment;
* Diagnostic questionnaires
* Design of MCQs with distractors
* Assessment of training quality, participant and instructor performance;
* Systematic Feedback;
* (Short and long term) Post-course feedback.

# Ideas for Challenges:

  * Design a diagnostic questionnaire;
  * Plan a session;
  * Design a course schedule;
  * Draw a concept map for a session;
  * Prepare a mini-presentation (3-mins); video yourself while delivering it; watch the video; adjust the mini-session and run it again [notice that you have to find a topic that can be taught in 3 minutes; it could be from any field]
  * Collect responses dynamically using Socrative or Learning Catalytics;
  * Create a group discussion and its annotation;
