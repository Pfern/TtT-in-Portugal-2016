Quotes form "Peer Intruction, Getting students to think in class" by Erik Mazur , pdf available [here](http://mazur.harvard.edu/sentFiles/Mazur_274537.pdf)

".. while listening is largely a passive activity, reading more easily engages the mind and it allows more time for the imagination to explore questions." 

"the first exposure to new material comes from reading printed material before the lecture reading."

Long term assessments are rather difficult. First becaulse learners move and become more diffuicult to cantact with. Secondly because they forget, as all of us do. In this case they forget what worked for them as hidden details. Those may matter because what we are looking for, here, is the aseesment of impacts that endure.

Interviewing former course participants would be a possibility but it requires a lot of time. Sending them short questions by e-mail has worked  with a yeald of about 30%, so unless you are tarining at least several hundreds of people it is likely that you end-up with a very small number of answers. Currently we see some home in the usage of social networks to collect valuable data.

Critical appraisals often happen is casual conversations. One should take notes to record them.
